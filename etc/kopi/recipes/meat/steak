Pan only: (thin steaks, < 1")
- heat pan to 200°C
- cook until visible from the side
- flip, cook roughly the same again

Reverse-sear (thicker steaks, > 1"):
- (Optional) dry brine with salt 1-5 hours ahead of time and leave in fridge
- Preheat oven to 110°C
- Cook in oven until internal temp is 48°C (for med-rare)
- Put in fridge for up to 30 mins to cool the crust region (minimises grey line)
- Heat pan to 180°C (traditionally 240°C but aparently 180 okay)
- Sear steak in hot pan to get crust
- Turn regularly, no more than 30s per-side (grey line bad)

Regular sear:
- Heat pan to 200°C (maybe too hot, tbd)
- Heat oven to 125°C
- Sear both sides, 30s per side at a time, keep turning til happy
- Once good crust, put in oven until internal temp reaches 48°C (TODO: confirm)
- [Optional] sear agin at the end for heat and final crust
