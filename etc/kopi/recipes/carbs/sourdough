  - 350g water (70%)
  - 50g active stiff starter (10%)
  - 10g salt

  - if it tears, knead 2-3 mins, rest 10 mins, repeat
- cover bowl and let dough rise, 6-12 hrs, but go based on criteria:
  - 30% - 50% volume rise (use aliquot jar)
  - surface bubbles visible
  - jiggly texture when bowl shaken
  - sweet/sour smell
- shape into batard (oval) or boulard (round)
  - flip dough from bowl onto bench (i.e. topside in bowl -> bottomside on bench)
    - this is because topside in bowl is slightly drier
  - fold (sticky) now-topside over a few times
    - right to middle
    - left to middle
    - top to middle
  - roll top to middle to yield a smooth topside

- set oven to 230°C with dutch oven inside and preheat for 30 mins
